## Description
This project involves setting up a home lab using Oracle VirtualBox to create a network environment with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019. The lab will utilize Active Directory (AD) for user management, leveraging PowerShell to automate the creation of random users. This setup aims to provide hands-on experience in managing AD, enhancing skills in Windows Server administration, and scripting with PowerShell. Users will learn how to configure AD, implement user policies, and generate user accounts efficiently through PowerShell commands.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **PowerShell**

## Environments Used 

- **Windows 10**
- **Windows Server 2019**
- **Oracle VirtualBox**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Start by installing Oracle VirtualBox on your host machine. This software will allow you to create and manage virtual machines.

### Step 3: Install Guest Additions and Configure Static IP Address
1. Once the Windows Server installation is complete, install the Guest Additions to improve performance:
   - Go to the VirtualBox menu and select **Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image**.
2. Change the server's hostname:
   - Go to **Server Manager > Local Server** and find the **Computer Name** section. Click on **Change**.
3. Set a static IP address on the internal network:
   - Navigate to **Network and Sharing Center**, select **Change adapter settings**, right-click on the network adapter, and select **Properties**. Configure the IP address.

### Step 4: Configure Server Roles
1. Open **Server Manager**. You will see a dashboard with server information.
2. Click on **Add roles and features** to open the wizard.
3. Select **Role-based or feature-based installation** and choose your server from the server pool.
4. Install the following roles:
   - **DHCP Server**
   - **Routing**

### Step 5: Promote to Domain Controller
1. In Server Manager, you will see a notification flag indicating the AD DS role has been installed. Click on it to promote the server to a Domain Controller.
2. Use the **Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard**:
   - Choose to add a new forest and enter **mydomain.com** as the domain name.
3. Complete the wizard and allow the server to restart.

### Step 6: Configure Routing and Remote Access

After promoting your server, access **Routing and Remote Access** from Server Manager.

1. Click on **Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access**.
2. Proceed with the default options by clicking **Next**.
3. Choose **NAT** for the network topology and select the **Internal Network** option.
